# 2D_Gaussian
Code and files for 2D Gaussian Fitting of YBs 

2Dgaussian_bkgroundremoved.py is the code used in Wolf-Chase et al. 2021 (WKD21) to generate the 2D Gaussian fits. Inputs are DR2-YBclass30-40_wID.csv and the background-removed, post-photometry, cropped 8 and 24 um image files. In WKD21, these files were create by Katie Devine's photometry only. These cropped images are found in resid_for_WKD21.tgz. In updated work, we can average the output files to generate an "averaged" file for fitting.
